üö¶ How to Use This List
Prioritize features that are bold or marked [MVP] for your first launch.

Once you‚Äôre ‚Äúin prod,‚Äù expand on others (financials, more custom reporting, feedback, image uploads, etc.).

If you want, I can convert this to a spreadsheet or checklist format for your workflow.

‚úÖ Suggested Next Steps
Review and confirm this list ‚Äî add/remove items as per your vision.

Lock the ‚Äúdefinition of done‚Äù for each‚ÄîMVP keeps every feature lean.

Decide parallel tracks: (A) finish remaining ERP core, (B) kickstart and launch Public App with Home, Initiatives/Events, and Login/Registration.

If you want sample navigation/main.dart or UI for the public app, just say so.
