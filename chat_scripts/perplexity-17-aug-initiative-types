# Initiative goals beyond fundraising

Absolutely—initiatives can and should support multiple goal types beyond pure fundraising, especially for something like “Masjid Project – Phase 2.” The structure suggested is solid:
- Initiative
  - Multiple Campaigns under the initiative
  - Multiple Tasks under each Campaign
  - Optional direct Tasks linked to the Initiative (not tied to a specific campaign)

## How to model this in your app

- Initiative fields:
  - name, description, status, start/end dates
  - goalType: enum/string (e.g., fundraising, construction, compliance, community_engagement, procurement, operations, education, it_systems, hse, services, stewardship, governance, sustainability)
  - goalTargets: map to capture KPIs (e.g., targetMilestones, targetApprovals, targetVolunteers)
- Campaign fields:
  - initiativeRef, name, type (optional), KPIs/counters relevant to type
- Task fields:
  - Either campaignRef or initiativeRef (allow null for one, enforce at least one)
  - type, priority, assignee, dueDate, status, checklist support

Validation rules:
- A task must link to either campaignRef or initiativeRef (not strictly both).
- For fundraising campaigns, keep existing amount-based KPIs; for others, store counts/milestones.

UI tweaks:
- Initiative create form: choose Goal Type → dynamically show fields/KPIs relevant to that type.
- Dashboard filters by goalType for quick visibility.

Would a ready-to-drop list of goalType constants and an Initiative schema patch help? I can provide a compact patch card to extend your Initiative model, forms, and Firestore structure with goalType and goalTargets, plus a guard in Task create to enforce “at least one of campaignRef/initiativeRef.”
