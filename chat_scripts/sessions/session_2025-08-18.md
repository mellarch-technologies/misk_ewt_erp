# Session Summary â€” 2025-08-18

Purpose
- Fast resume for next chat without reloading full history.

Context Snapshot
- Project: MISK ERP Mini (Flutter + Firebase)
- Workspace: E:\MiSK\app\misk_ewt_erp
- Modules touched: Campaigns, Donations, Tasks, Settings/Admin
- Files edited today:
  - lib/providers/campaign_provider.dart
  - lib/screens/campaigns/campaigns_list_screen.dart
  - lib/services/donation_service.dart
  - lib/screens/donations/donations_list_screen.dart
  - lib/screens/tasks/tasks_list_screen.dart
  - lib/screens/settings/global_settings_screen.dart
- Reference: project_log.md updated with the same batch summary.

Changes Implemented (Today)
- Campaigns: show Initiative name chip (resolve initiative ref -> title with provider cache).
- Donations: filters (Method/Status/Unreconciled) + quick actions (Mark Confirmed, toggle Bank Reconciled, Edit Bank Ref/UTR). Quick edits recompute initiative roll-ups.
- Tasks: Status filter and "My tasks" (uses AppAuthProvider uid vs assignedTo ref). Chips for Campaign/Initiative links.
- Admin (Settings): one-click "Recompute roll-ups (all initiatives)" action.

Quick Test Cues
- Campaigns: list shows Initiative chip names; pull-to-refresh works.
- Donations: filter by method/status/unreconciled; try quick actions and see Snackbar + totals refresh.
- Tasks: filter by status; toggle My tasks to see items assigned to current user; link chips visible.
- Settings: run Recompute roll-ups; success snackbar shows initiative count.

Known Notes
- Minor Flutter deprecation warnings (DropdownButtonFormField.value); safe to defer.
- Payment Settings E2E still pending; Donations bulk reconcile UX optional.

Resume Checklist (Next)
- Tasks: form polish + CRUD wiring; delete with re-auth.
- Donations: optional bulk reconcile UI; small UX polish.
- Campaigns form: optional fields (dates/costs/proposedBy).
- QA: Payment Settings E2E + Donations reconciliation flow.

How to Resume New Chat
- Say: "Read project_log.md and chat_scripts/sessions/session_2025-08-18.md, then continue from Resume Checklist."
