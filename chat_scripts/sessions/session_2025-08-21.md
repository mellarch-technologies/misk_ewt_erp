Clear).
Cards now use CommonCard + MiskBadge (status/campaign/initiative).
Delete with re-auth and edit flow preserved.
Analyzer: PASS.
UsersListScreen
Switched to CommonCard and MiskBadge (designation/status/joined) for consistent visuals.
Delete with re-auth and add/edit navigation unchanged.
Analyzer: PASS.
EventsAnnouncementsListScreen
Wrapped filters in FilterBar (Type + Public only + Clear).
Replaced chips with MiskBadge (type/public/featured/date/initiative) inside CommonCard.
Delete with re-auth and edit flow kept.
Analyzer: PASS.
Documentation
Updated project_log.md with a new entry summarizing the pattern rollout and deprecation fix.
Quality gates
Static checks on all modified files: PASS.
Deprecated DropdownButtonFormField.value removed from Donations filters.
Next steps
Finish token pass for card radii/shadows and unify any outlier AppBars/headers.
Manual QA: Payment Settings E2E and Donations reconciliation flow.
Optional: port Roles list to CommonCard/MiskBadge for full visual parity.
Then proceed to Avatar Photo upload backend (Shared Hosting/Drive) as planned.
If you’d like, I can extend this visual pattern to any remaining lists or detail screens next.
Here’s a tight plan and what I’ve already wired so you can finish uploads on shared hosting, then circle back to UI/UX polish.
What I completed now
Shared hosting integration
Added docs/integrations/SHARED_UPLOADS_SETUP.md with end-to-end setup, security, and curl tests.
Added a secure sample PHP endpoint at docs/integrations/server/upload.php (apiKey check, size/type validation, random filenames, safe dirs).
App config via dart-define (no code edits needed to switch backends).
PhotoRepository now accepts directory and sends it to the server; UserForm uploads go to users/{uid}/photos (or users/pending/{timestamp}/photos).
UI parity
RolesListScreen refactored to CommonCard + MiskBadge for consistency with Campaigns/Donations/Tasks/Users/Events.
Sanity checks
Modified files compile with no errors; dropdown deprecations resolved where touched.
Recommended hosting setup
Subdomain: uploads.erp.misk.org.in (or media.erp.misk.org.in). Avoid “ftp.” for upload endpoints.
Structure
/api/upload.php (HTTPS endpoint)
/uploads/ (public files)
Folders by module: users/{uid}/photos, initiatives/{id}/covers, campaigns/{id}/posters, events/{id}/posters
Security
Require a strong apiKey in upload.php (don’t commit it to git).
Enforce size/type checks, random filenames, normalized dir.
.htaccess in /uploads: disable PHP execution, disable directory listing (documented in the guide).
Deploy steps (shared hosting)
Create subdomain → docroot.
Create /api and /uploads folders.
Upload docs/integrations/server/upload.php to /api/upload.php and set API_KEY.
Add .htaccess rules from the guide to /uploads.
Test:
curl:
curl -F "file=@avatar.jpg" -F "apiKey=YOUR_SECRET" -F "dir=users/demo/photos" https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php
Expect JSON { "url": "https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/uploads/users/demo/photos/..." }
Wire the app (no code changes)
Run with dart-define:
flutter run \
--dart-define=PHOTO_BACKEND=sharedHosting \
--dart-define=SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL=https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php \
--dart-define=SHARED_API_KEY=YOUR_SECRET
In User Form, enable “Allow Photo Upload” → Upload Photo. Files will land under users/{uid}/photos.
About FTP vs token
Don’t embed FTP creds in the app (insecure, hard to rotate).
Use the HTTPS upload.php with a shared apiKey (already supported). You can rotate the key by updating the server and your run flags.
Optional: upgrade to HMAC signature later (hook documented in the guide).
What’s still pending in UI/UX (quick list)
Token pass (radii/shadows) on settings screens (Payment, Global, Security) to match CommonCard rhythm.
AppBar/header audits on outlier screens.
Accessibility sizing for trailing actions and semantics on key buttons.
Optional: add upload buttons to Campaign/Initiative/Event forms similar to User Form, targeting the suggested module folders.
Next actions I can take
Apply CommonCard/spacing tokens to Payment/Global/Security screens.
Add a minimal “Server Uploads” section in settings to show current backend info and run a test ping.
Add upload buttons to Campaign/Initiative/Event forms (uses the same backend) if you want this now.
If you want me to proceed immediately, I’ll polish the settings screens and add the docs link in-app, then add upload buttons for the campaign/event assets.

I’ve wired the app to your shared hosting endpoint and organized uploads by user/module. Here’s what I changed and exactly how to run with your key.
What I changed in code (summary)
app_config.dart
Reads backend settings from dart-define: PHOTO_BACKEND, SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL, SHARED_API_KEY, DRIVE_FOLDER_ID.
photo_repository.dart
Upload now accepts directory and sends it to server as dir along with apiKey.
users/user_form_screen.dart
Upload Photo sends files to users/{uid}/photos (falls back to users/pending/{timestamp}/photos before uid exists).
Docs
docs/integrations/SHARED_UPLOADS_SETUP.md
docs/integrations/server/upload.php (secure PHP handler with size/type checks, apiKey, safe dirs).
How to run with your live endpoint and key Replace the URL below with your actual upload.php if it differs.
flutter run \
--dart-define=PHOTO_BACKEND=sharedHosting \
--dart-define=SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL=https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php \
--dart-define=SHARED_API_KEY=e4f9c1a7b3d84c2f9a6e5d1c3a9b7f2e
Quick test (no demo files needed)
ERP → Users → Add/Edit a user → enable “Allow Photo Upload” → Upload Photo.
The server will create:
users/{uid}/photos/…jpg (for existing users)
users/pending/{timestamp}/photos/…jpg (for new, unsaved users)
Verify your uploads folder shows the new file and the app displays the returned URL.
Optional server sanity check Use curl to verify the endpoint returns a public URL (adjust path as needed):
curl -F "file=@avatar.jpg" \
-F "apiKey=e4f9c1a7b3d84c2f9a6e5d1c3a9b7f2e" \
-F "dir=users/demo/photos" \
https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php
Notes
Don’t hardcode the key in code; keep using dart-define.
The PHP upload script is at docs/integrations/server/upload.php with security checks; ensure your /uploads has the .htaccess rules from the guide.
UI/UX polish items remain on the list (settings screens token pass, AppBar/header audits, accessibility sizing). I can proceed with those next once you confirm uploads work end-to-end.

Here’s what I wired and how to ship without hardcoding, then we’ll verify your live endpoint with your key.
What I changed (in code)
AppConfig: reads upload backend from dart-define (PHOTO_BACKEND, SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL, SHARED_API_KEY).
PhotoRepository: sends apiKey and dir to your endpoint; accepts directory for organized uploads.
UserForm upload: saves to users/{uid}/photos (or users/pending/{timestamp}/photos before uid exists).
Docs: added SHARED_UPLOADS_SETUP.md and a secure sample PHP handler.
How to run locally with your live key Use your real endpoint and key; this won’t be committed to code.
Replace with your host if different.
flutter run \
--dart-define=PHOTO_BACKEND=sharedHosting \
--dart-define=SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL=https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php \
--dart-define=SHARED_API_KEY=e4f9c1a7b3d84c2f9a6e5d1c3a9b7f2e
Your “Additional run args” in Run Config is perfect; no code changes needed.
Ship to Play Store (no hardcoding)
Build an App Bundle with dart-define. This injects the values at build time.
flutter build appbundle --release \
--dart-define=PHOTO_BACKEND=sharedHosting \
--dart-define=SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL=https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php \
--dart-define=SHARED_API_KEY=e4f9c1a7b3d84c2f9a6e5d1c3a9b7f2e
Notes about secrets in binaries
dart-define values are embedded in the app and can be extracted. Treat them as configuration, not true secrets.
Mitigate on server (already covered by the sample PHP):
Enforce content-type/size, random filenames, path sanitization, non-executable uploads.
Rotate the key periodically; consider adding HMAC+timestamp later if you want stronger protection.
Quick in-app test
Go to Users → Add/Edit → enable “Allow Photo Upload” → Upload Photo.
The first upload will create folders and place a file under users/{uid}/photos (or users/pending/{ts}/photos if it’s a new user).
If you want, I can extend the same upload button to Campaign/Initiative/Event forms next (covers banners/posters), then resume the UI/UX polish pass you mentioned.

Here’s what I did and what’s next: I captured the uploads discussion, wired the app to your live endpoint/key via dart-define, and documented rotation/shipping details.
What I recorded
project_log.md: added [2025-08-21] Shared Hosting Uploads — Live Config, Key Rotation, Action List.
chat_scripts/sessions/session_2025-08-20.md: appended [2025-08-21] Uploads Setup — Discussion Notes, Rotation, and Shipping.
Both note when uploads discussion started (2025-08-16 planning → 2025-08-21 live key), current config, rotation policy, Play Store build steps, and a concrete action checklist.
What I wired in code
AppConfig reads PHOTO_BACKEND, SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL, SHARED_API_KEY (dart-define).
PhotoRepository sends apiKey and dir; UserForm upload targets users/{uid}/photos (or users/pending/{ts}/photos).
Answer: key changes and Play Store
Yes, changing the key means rebuilding with new --dart-define and publishing an update.
Recommended rotation: temporarily allow old+new keys on the server, release a new build with the new key, then retire the old key once users update.
Future (no-rebuild): move to short‑lived HMAC tokens minted by your server.
Run and build (replace endpoint if yours differs)
Local run:
flutter run \
--dart-define=PHOTO_BACKEND=sharedHosting \
--dart-define=SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL=https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php \
--dart-define=SHARED_API_KEY=e4f9c1a7b3d84c2f9a6e5d1c3a9b7f2e
Play Store bundle:
flutter build appbundle --release \
--dart-define=PHOTO_BACKEND=sharedHosting \
--dart-define=SHARED_ENDPOINT_URL=https://uploads.erp.misk.org.in/api/upload.php \
--dart-define=SHARED_API_KEY=e4f9c1a7b3d84c2f9a6e5d1c3a9b7f2e
Quick test
Users → Add/Edit → Allow Photo Upload → Upload Photo; first upload will create folders/files under uploads/.
Optional curl check is documented in docs/integrations/SHARED_UPLOADS_SETUP.md.
Action checklist (next)
Add upload buttons to Campaign/Initiative/Event forms (module folders).
Settings tile: show backend info + test ping.
Optional hardening: HMAC/time-window tokens; CI secrets for releases.
Notes
I did not store your key in the repo.
Modified files compile clean; docs added: SHARED_UPLOADS_SETUP.md and server/upload.php.


Thanks for the detailed test results—here’s what I fixed and how to verify quickly.
What I changed (to fix the “photo disappears” issue)
Auto-persist after upload
When you upload a photo for an existing user, the app now immediately updates Firestore users/{uid}.photo and updatedAt.
The Users list is auto-refreshed so the new avatar appears without pressing Save.
Users list avatar
The list now renders user.photo when available (fallback to initials only if photo is missing).
Why this helps
Your “photo shows in form but vanishes in list” was due to the URL not being persisted until Save. It’s now saved immediately and reflected in the list.
How to retest (Muhammad tanveerullah)
Open Users → pull to refresh.
Card for “Muhammad tanveerullah” should show the uploaded avatar (not initials).
If not, open the user → tap Upload Photo again → watch for “Photo uploaded” → go back → pull to refresh.
About the web “ClientException: URL not found”
Likely causes:
The image URL returned doesn’t resolve on web (typo or wrong base path).
Mixed content (http image on https app) blocked by browser.
Hotlinking or missing headers (rare for plain image display).
Quick checks:
Ensure the returned URL is https and loads in a separate browser tab.
Make sure uploads are publicly accessible at that URL path (docroot and /uploads mapping right).
Optional: add Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * for safety (some web setups benefit, though images generally don’t need CORS to display).
What I did behind the scenes
Updated user_form_screen.dart to persist photo immediately after upload and refresh the list.
Updated users_list_screen.dart to render photo URLs in avatars.
Verified no compile/type errors on these changes.
Next steps I can take
If web still throws a client exception, share one example failing URL and I’ll adjust the server path mapping or the client URL trim/validation.
I can also add a small “Test Image URL” button in Settings → Uploads to verify reachability and headers from within the app.
