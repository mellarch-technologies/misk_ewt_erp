# Session — 2025-08-23 — AppBar/Nav Spec Alignment + Dashboard Kickoff

Scope
- Align AppShell/AppBar/Nav with the comprehensive design specs.
- Kick off Dashboard UX enhancements: pull-to-refresh and infographics.

Changes Applied
- Navigation
  - NavigationRail breakpoint set to 768px (was 800).
  - Rail and BottomNav now show only the 5 primary tabs: Dashboard, Initiatives, Campaigns, Donations, Settings.
  - Users and Events & Announcements remain in Drawer (permission-gated) to keep BottomNav lean.
- Dashboard
  - Pull-to-refresh (RefreshIndicator) to reload providers + donations snapshot.
  - Infographics (Masjid initiative): Financial donut (Goal vs Confirmed vs Reconciled), 8-week donations trend, Task status bars.
  - Featured sliders for Initiatives and Campaigns.
  - KPI grid kept to 2-up on phones; threshold tightened.

Files
- lib/widgets/app_shell.dart
- lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart
- lib/widgets/dashboard_charts.dart (new)
- lib/widgets/campaign_card.dart (new)
- pubspec.yaml (fl_chart added)

Validation
- Static checks on modified files: PASS (only benign unused warnings left).
- Dependencies fetched: fl_chart installed.

Next (per specs)
- KPI cards → CommonCard style + Roles KPI + trend badges/sparkline; format amounts in L/Cr.
- Donations → add date range picker + filter-summary chips; polish bulk reconcile summary/undo.
- Settings → add uploads backend health tile + search.
- Pagination (20/page) across lists; verify Firestore indexes.

- Dashboard
  - Increased grid tile height in “My Tasks” and “Recent Activities” (childAspectRatio 2.2) to avoid vertical overflow on medium widths.
  - Added Roles KPI to the KPI grid (using RoleProvider); donations totals already formatted in L/Cr via CurrencyHelper.
- Validation
  - Static check on lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart: PASS (only benign `_userDesignation` unused warning remains).
- Notes
  - KPI skeletons remain minimal; will switch KPI visuals to CommonCard + trend badges in the next pass.

- Donations
  - Added Date Range picker, active filter-summary chips, and a filtered vs total counter.
  - Bulk Reconcile now shows a SnackBar with UNDO action to revert.
- Validation
