# MISK EWT ERP — Session Log (2025-08-22)

## Summary
- Restored consistent left navigation (NavigationRail ≥ 800px; Drawer + BottomNav on smaller screens).
- Dashboard aligned to plan: Welcome → KPIs → My Tasks → Recent Activities (last).
- KPIs now use two-card layout on typical screens, fallback to one on ultra-narrow.
- Live KPIs include donations: confirmed and reconciled totals (formatted in INR).
- Recent Activities unified feed shows events, donations, and tasks with timestamps and icons.
- Overflow issues resolved via responsive grids and shrink-wrapped lists.

## Key Changes
- main.dart: route '/dashboard' → AppShell to ensure left nav.
- widgets/app_shell.dart: lowered rail breakpoint to 800px; added Drawer on small screens.
- screens/dashboard_screen.dart: two-column KPIs; donations totals; unified activities; section order fixed.
- theme/app_theme.dart: tokens used; deprecations updated earlier.
- project_log.md: new version entry added for visibility and alignment.

## Decisions
- Prioritize UI/UX consistency before further features.
- Add permission-based visibility for dashboard sections next.
- Continue with public app after dashboard polish and pending tweaks.

## Next Steps
1) Live KPIs for donations at initiative/campaign granularity (optional filters).
2) Unified feed polishing (link to detail pages; “View all” actions).
3) Permission gating across KPIs and sections.
4) Public app foundation: Bank/UPI/Razorpay flows; settings-driven recommendations.

## Notes
- Analyzer: PASS on modified files.
- Currency formatting uses CurrencyHelper.formatInr.
- Donations sourced via DonationService; roll-ups remain handled by RollupService during donation edits.
